When anchor text is discovered, it is stored on disk by the AnchorStore class.
This file gives the specification for how that data is stored.

1 of the following:
- (sizeof(std::atomic<fb::SizeT>)) Bytes: Cursor
    *These bytes are reserved by the atomic cursor which is used to write to the file.
    *This should be 8 bytes, but may depend on implementation of std::atomic.
The rest of the file is an array of the following structures:
- 64 Bytes: Chunk (56 bytes text, 8 bytes offset)
    *The first 56 bytes are anchor text corresponding to some URL.
    *The final 8 bytes are an offset into the array of chunks, which refers to
     the next chunk which contains anchor text corresponding to the same URL.
    *Additional notes: We do not distinguish the boundary between different anchor
     text for the same URL. For example, if two different anchor texts "Hello!"
     and "World!" are both discovered for the same URL, the resulting text in the
     anchor text file may contain "Hello! World!", "World! Hello!", or "Hello!"
     and "World!" may even be separated by other anchor text.
    *The purpose of chunking the anchor text into a fixed size is so that multiple
     threads can write concurrently to this file, by advancing a shared atomic cursor.
