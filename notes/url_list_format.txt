When a Url is discovered, it is stored on disk by the UrlStore class.
This file gives the specification for how this data is stored.

1 of the following:
- (sizeof(std::atomic<fb::SizeT>)) Bytes: Cursor
    *These bytes are reserved by the atomic cursor which is used to write to the file.
    *This should be 8 bytes, but may depend on implementation of std::atomic.
For each Url U, 1 of the following
- (Length of U) + 1 byes: Url
    *U written as a null-terminated C-string.
    *Additional notes: U's corresponding UrlInfo structure contains a SizeT which
     gives the offset of U within this file. Throughout the duration of our programs,
     U can now be uniquely identified by this offset.
