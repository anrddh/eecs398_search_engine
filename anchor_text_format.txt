When anchor text is discovered, it is stored on disk by the AnchorStore class.
This file gives the specification for how that data is stored.

1 of the following:
- (sizeof(std::atomic<fb::SizeT>)) Bytes: Cursor
    *These bytes are reserved by the atomic cursor which is used to write to the file.
    *This should be 8 bytes, but may depend on implementation of std::atomic.
The rest of the file is an array of the following:
- TODO: Finish writing this.
