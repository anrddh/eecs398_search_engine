one
september
night
a
family
had
gathered
round
their
hearth
and
piled
it
high
with
the
driftwood
of
mountain
streams
the
dry
cones
of
the
pine
and
the
splintered
ruins
of
great
trees
that
had
come
crashing
down
the
precipice
up
the
chimney
roared
the
fire
and
brightened
the
room
with
its
broad
blaze
the
faces
of
the
father
and
mother
had
a
sober
gladness
the
children
laughed
the
eldest
daughter
was
the
image
of
happiness
at
seventeen
and
the
aged
grandmother
who
sat
knitting
in
the
warmest
place
was
the
image
of
happiness
grown
old
they
had
found
the
herb
heart'sease
in
the
bleakest
spot
of
all
new
england
this
family
were
situated
in
the
notch
of
the
white
hills
where
the
wind
was
sharp
throughout
the
year
and
pitilessly
cold
in
the
wintergiving
their
cottage
all
its
fresh
inclemency
before
it
descended
on
the
valley
of
the
saco
they
dwelt
in
a
cold
spot
and
a
dangerous
one
for
a
mountain
towered
above
their
heads
so
steep
that
the
stones
would
often
rumble
down
its
sides
and
startle
them
at
midnight
the
daughter
had
just
uttered
some
simple
jest
that
filled
them
all
with
mirth
when
the
wind
came
through
the
notch
and
seemed
to
pause
before
their
cottagerattling
the
door
with
a
sound
of
wailing
and
lamentation
before
it
passed
into
the
valley
for
a
moment
it
saddened
them
though
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
the
tones
but
the
family
were
glad
again
when
they
perceived
that
the
latch
was
lifted
by
some
traveller
whose
footsteps
had
been
unheard
amid
the
dreary
blast
which
heralded
his
approach
and
wailed
as
he
was
entering
and
went
moaning
away
from
the
door
though
they
dwelt
in
such
a
solitude
these
people
held
daily
converse
with
the
world
the
romantic
pass
of
the
notch
is
a
great
artery
through
which
the
lifeblood
of
internal
commerce
is
continually
throbbing
between
maine
on
one
side
and
the
green
mountains
and
the
shores
of
the
st
lawrence
on
the
other
the
stagecoach
always
drew
up
before
the
door
of
the
cottage
the
wayfarer
with
no
companion
but
his
staff
paused
here
to
exchange
a
word
that
the
sense
of
loneliness
might
not
utterly
overcome
him
ere
he
could
pass
through
the
cleft
of
the
mountain
or
reach
the
first
house
in
the
valley
and
here
the
teamster
on
his
way
to
portland
market
would
put
up
for
the
night
and
if
a
bachelor
might
sit
an
hour
beyond
the
usual
bedtime
and
steal
a
kiss
from
the
mountain
maid
at
parting
it
was
one
of
those
primitive
taverns
where
the
traveller
pays
only
for
food
and
lodging
but
meets
with
a
homely
kindness
beyond
all
price
when
the
footsteps
were
heard
therefore
between
the
outer
door
and
the
inner
one
the
whole
family
rose
up
grandmother
children
and
all
as
if
about
to
welcome
someone
who
belonged
to
them
and
whose
fate
was
linked
with
theirs
the
door
was
opened
by
a
young
man
his
face
at
first
wore
the
melancholy
expression
almost
despondency
of
one
who
travels
a
wild
and
bleak
road
at
nightfall
and
alone
but
soon
brightened
up
when
he
saw
the
kindly
warmth
of
his
reception
he
felt
his
heart
spring
forward
to
meet
them
all
from
the
old
woman
who
wiped
a
chair
with
her
apron
to
the
little
child
that
held
out
its
arms
to
him
one
glance
and
smile
placed
the
stranger
on
a
footing
of
innocent
familiarity
with
the
eldest
daughter
ah
this
fire
is
the
right
thing
cried
he
especially
when
there
is
such
a
pleasant
circle
round
it
i
am
quite
benumbed
for
the
notch
is
just
like
the
pipe
of
a
great
pair
of
bellows
it
has
blown
a
terrible
blast
in
my
face
all
the
way
from
bartlett
then
you
are
going
towards
vermont
said
the
master
of
the
house
as
he
helped
to
take
a
light
knapsack
off
the
young
man's
shoulders
yes
to
burlington
and
far
enough
beyond
replied
he
i
meant
to
have
been
at
ethan
crawford's
tonight
but
a
pedestrian
lingers
along
such
a
road
as
this
it
is
no
matter
for
when
i
saw
this
good
fire
and
all
your
cheerful
faces
i
felt
as
if
you
had
kindled
it
on
purpose
for
me
and
were
waiting
my
arrival
so
i
shall
sit
down
among
you
and
make
myself
at
home
the
frankhearted
stranger
had
just
drawn
his
chair
to
the
fire
when
something
like
a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
without
rushing
down
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain
as
with
long
and
rapid
strides
and
taking
such
a
leap
in
passing
the
cottage
as
to
strike
the
opposite
precipice
the
family
held
their
breath
because
they
knew
the
sound
and
their
guest
held
his
by
instinct
the
old
mountain
has
thrown
a
stone
at
us
for
fear
we
should
forget
him
said
the
landlord
recovering
himself
he
sometimes
nods
his
head
and
threatens
to
come
down
but
we
are
old
neighbors
and
agree
together
pretty
well
upon
the
whole
besides
we
have
a
sure
place
of
refuge
hard
by
if
he
should
be
coming
in
good
earnest
let
us
now
suppose
the
stranger
to
have
finished
his
supper
of
bear's
meat
and
by
his
natural
felicity
of
manner
to
have
placed
himself
on
a
footing
of
kindness
with
the
whole
family
so
that
they
talked
as
freely
together
as
if
he
belonged
to
their
mountain
brood
he
was
of
a
proud
yet
gentle
spirithaughty
and
reserved
among
the
rich
and
great
but
ever
ready
to
stoop
his
head
to
the
lowly
cottage
door
and
be
like
a
brother
or
a
son
at
the
poor
man's
fireside
in
the
household
of
the
notch
he
found
warmth
and
simplicity
of
feeling
the
pervading
intelligence
of
new
england
and
a
poetry
of
native
growth
which
they
had
gathered
when
they
little
thought
of
it
from
the
mountain
peaks
and
chasms
and
at
the
very
threshold
of
their
romantic
and
dangerous
abode
he
had
travelled
far
and
alone
his
whole
life
indeed
had
been
a
solitary
path
for
with
the
lofty
caution
of
his
nature
he
had
kept
himself
apart
from
those
who
might
otherwise
have
been
his
companions
the
family
too
though
so
kind
and
hospitable
had
that
consciousness
of
unity
among
themselves
and
separation
from
the
world
at
large
which
in
every
domestic
circle
should
still
keep
a
holy
place
where
no
stranger
may
intrude
but
this
evening
a
prophetic
sympathy
impelled
the
refined
and
educated
youth
to
pour
out
his
heart
before
the
simple
mountaineers
and
constrained
them
to
answer
him
with
the
same
free
confidence
and
thus
it
should
have
been
is
not
the
kindred
of
a
common
fate
a
closer
tie
than
that
of
birth
the
secret
of
the
young
man's
character
was
a
high
and
abstracted
ambition
he
could
have
borne
to
live
an
undistinguished
life
but
not
to
be
forgotten
in
the
grave
yearning
desire
had
been
transformed
to
hope
and
hope
long
cherished
had
become
like
certainty
that
obscurely
as
he
journeyed
now
a
glory
was
to
beam
on
all
his
pathwaythough
not
perhaps
while
he
was
treading
it
but
when
posterity
should
gaze
back
into
the
gloom
of
what
was
now
the
present
they
would
trace
the
brightness
of
his
footsteps
brightening
as
meaner
glories
faded
and
confess
that
a
gifted
one
had
passed
from
his
cradle
to
his
tomb
with
none
to
recognize
him
as
yet
cried
the
strangerhis
cheek
glowing
and
his
eye
flashing
with
enthusiasmas
yet
i
have
done
nothing
were
i
to
vanish
from
the
earth
tomorrow
none
would
know
so
much
of
me
as
you
that
a
nameless
youth
came
up
at
nightfall
from
the
valley
of
the
saco
and
opened
his
heart
to
you
in
the
evening
and
passed
through
the
notch
by
sunrise
and
was
seen
no
more
not
a
soul
would
ask
'who
was
he
whither
did
the
wanderer
go'
but
i
cannot
die
till
i
have
achieved
my
destiny
then
let
death
come
i
shall
have
built
my
monument
there
was
a
continual
flow
of
natural
emotion
gushing
forth
amid
abstracted
reverie
which
enabled
the
family
to
understand
this
young
man's
sentiments
though
so
foreign
from
their
own
with
quick
sensibility
of
the
ludicrous
he
blushed
at
the
ardor
into
which
he
had
been
betrayed
you
laugh
at
me
said
he
taking
the
eldest
daughter's
hand
and
laughing
himself
you
think
my
ambition
as
nonsensical
as
if
i
were
to
freeze
myself
to
death
on
the
top
of
mount
washington
only
that
people
might
spy
at
me
from
the
country
round
about
and
truly
that
would
be
a
noble
pedestal
for
a
man's
statue
it
is
better
to
sit
here
by
this
fire
answered
the
girl
blushing
and
be
comfortable
and
contented
though
nobody
thinks
about
us
i
suppose
said
her
father
after
a
fit
of
musing
there
is
something
natural
in
what
the
young
man
says
and
if
my
mind
had
been
turned
that
way
i
might
have
felt
just
the
same
it
is
strange
wife
how
his
talk
has
set
my
head
running
on
things
that
are
pretty
certain
never
to
come
to
pass
perhaps
they
may
observed
the
wife
is
the
man
thinking
what
he
will
do
when
he
is
a
widower
no
no
cried
he
repelling
the
idea
with
reproachful
kindness
when
i
think
of
your
death
esther
i
think
of
mine
too
but
i
was
wishing
we
had
a
good
farm
in
bartlett
or
bethlehem
or
littleton
or
some
other
township
round
the
white
mountains
but
not
where
they
could
tumble
on
our
heads
i
should
want
to
stand
well
with
my
neighbors
and
be
called
squire
and
sent
to
general
court
for
a
term
or
two
for
a
plain
honest
man
may
do
as
much
good
there
as
a
lawyer
and
when
i
should
be
grown
quite
an
old
man
and
you
an
old
woman
so
as
not
to
be
long
apart
i
might
die
happy
enough
in
my
bed
and
leave
you
all
crying
around
me
a
slate
gravestone
would
suit
me
as
well
as
a
marble
onewith
just
my
name
and
age
and
a
verse
of
a
hymn
and
something
to
let
people
know
that
i
lived
an
honest
man
and
died
a
christian
there
now
exclaimed
the
stranger
it
is
our
nature
to
desire
a
monument
be
it
slate
or
marble
or
a
pillar
of
granite
or
a
glorious
memory
in
the
universal
heart
of
man
we're
in
a
strange
way
tonight
said
the
wife
with
tears
in
her
eyes
they
say
it's
a
sign
of
something
when
folks'
minds
go
awandering
so
hark
to
the
children
they
listened
accordingly
the
younger
children
had
been
put
to
bed
in
another
room
but
with
an
open
door
between
so
that
they
could
be
heard
talking
busily
among
themselves
one
and
all
seemed
to
have
caught
the
infection
from
the
fireside
circle
and
were
outvying
each
other
in
wild
wishes
and
childish
projects
of
what
they
would
do
when
they
came
to
be
men
and
women
at
length
a
little
boy
instead
of
addressing
his
brothers
and
sisters
called
out
to
his
mother
i'll
tell
you
what
i
wish
mother
cried
he
i
want
you
and
father
and
grandma'm
and
all
of
us
and
the
stranger
too
to
start
right
away
and
go
and
take
a
drink
out
of
the
basin
of
the
flume
nobody
could
help
laughing
at
the
child's
notion
of
leaving
a
warm
bed
and
dragging
them
from
a
cheerful
fire
to
visit
the
basin
of
the
flumea
brook
which
tumbles
over
the
precipice
deep
within
the
notch
the
boy
had
hardly
spoken
when
a
wagon
rattled
along
the
road
and
stopped
a
moment
before
the
door
it
appeared
to
contain
two
or
three
men
who
were
cheering
their
hearts
with
the
rough
chorus
of
a
song
which
resounded
in
broken
notes
between
the
cliffs
while
the
singers
hesitated
whether
to
continue
their
journey
or
put
up
here
for
the
night
father
said
the
girl
they
are
calling
you
by
name
but
the
good
man
doubted
whether
they
had
really
called
him
and
was
unwilling
to
show
himself
too
solicitous
of
gain
by
inviting
people
to
patronize
his
house
he
therefore
did
not
hurry
to
the
door
and
the
lash
being
soon
applied
the
travellers
plunged
into
the
notch
still
singing
and
laughing
though
their
music
and
mirth
came
back
drearily
from
the
heart
of
the
mountain
there
mother
cried
the
boy
again
they'd
have
given
us
a
ride
to
the
flume
again
they
laughed
at
the
child's
pertinacious
fancy
for
a
night
ramble
but
it
happened
that
a
light
cloud
passed
over
the
daughter's
spirit
she
looked
gravely
into
the
fire
and
drew
a
breath
that
was
almost
a
sigh
it
forced
its
way
in
spite
of
a
little
struggle
to
repress
it
then
starting
and
blushing
she
looked
quickly
round
the
circle
as
if
they
had
caught
a
glimpse
into
her
bosom
the
stranger
asked
what
she
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
answered
she
with
a
downcast
smile
only
i
felt
lonesome
just
then
oh
i
have
always
had
a
gift
of
feeling
what
is
in
other
people's
hearts
said
he
half
seriously
shall
i
tell
the
secrets
of
yours
for
i
know
what
to
think
when
a
young
girl
shivers
by
a
warm
hearth
and
complains
of
lonesomeness
at
her
mother's
side
shall
i
put
these
feelings
into
words
they
would
not
be
a
girl's
feelings
any
longer
if
they
could
be
put
into
words
replied
the
mountain
nymph
laughing
but
avoiding
his
eye
all
this
was
said
apart
perhaps
a
germ
of
love
was
springing
in
their
hearts
so
pure
that
it
might
blossom
in
paradise
since
it
could
not
be
matured
on
earth
for
women
worship
such
gentle
dignity
as
his
and
the
proud
contemplative
yet
kindly
soul
is
oftenest
captivated
by
simplicity
like
hers
but
while
they
spoke
softly
and
he
was
watching
the
happy
sadness
the
lightsome
shadows
the
shy
yearnings
of
a
maiden's
nature
the
wind
through
the
notch
took
a
deeper
and
drearier
sound
it
seemed
as
the
fanciful
stranger
said
like
the
choral
strain
of
the
spirits
of
the
blast
who
in
old
indian
times
had
their
dwelling
among
these
mountains
and
made
their
heights
and
recesses
a
sacred
region
there
was
a
wail
along
the
road
as
if
a
funeral
were
passing
to
chase
away
the
gloom
the
family
threw
pine
branches
on
their
fire
till
the
dry
leaves
crackled
and
the
flame
arose
discovering
once
again
a
scene
of
peace
and
humble
happiness
the
light
hovered
about
them
fondly
and
caressed
them
all
there
were
the
little
faces
of
the
children
peeping
from
their
bed
apart
and
here
the
father's
frame
of
strength
the
mother's
subdued
and
careful
mien
the
highbrowed
youth
the
budding
girl
and
the
good
old
grandam
still
knitting
in
the
warmest
place
the
aged
woman
looked
up
from
her
task
and
with
fingers
ever
busy
was
the
next
to
speak
old
folks
have
their
notions
said
she
as
well
as
young
ones
you've
been
wishing
and
planning
and
letting
your
heads
run
on
one
thing
and
another
till
you've
set
my
mind
awandering
too
now
what
should
an
old
woman
wish
for
when
she
can
go
but
a
step
or
two
before
she
comes
to
her
grave
children
it
will
haunt
me
night
and
day
till
i
tell
you
what
is
it
mother
cried
the
husband
and
wife
at
once
then
the
old
woman
with
an
air
of
mystery
which
drew
the
circle
closer
round
the
fire
informed
them
that
she
had
provided
her
graveclothes
some
years
beforea
nice
linen
shroud
a
cap
with
a
muslin
ruff
and
everything
of
a
finer
sort
than
she
had
worn
since
her
wedding
day
but
this
evening
an
old
superstition
had
strangely
recurred
to
her
it
used
to
be
said
in
her
younger
days
that
if
anything
were
amiss
with
a
corpse
if
only
the
ruff
were
not
smooth
or
the
cap
did
not
set
right
the
corpse
in
the
coffin
and
beneath
the
clods
would
strive
to
put
up
its
cold
hands
and
arrange
it
the
bare
thought
made
her
nervous
don't
talk
so
grandmother
said
the
girl
shuddering
now
continued
the
old
woman
with
singular
earnestness
yet
smiling
strangely
at
her
own
folly
i
want
one
of
you
my
children
when
your
mother
is
dressed
and
in
the
coffini
want
one
of
you
to
hold
a
lookingglass
over
my
face
who
knows
but
i
may
take
a
glimpse
at
myself
and
see
whether
all's
right
old
and
young
we
dream
of
graves
and
monuments
murmured
the
stranger
youth
i
wonder
how
mariners
feel
when
the
ship
is
sinking
and
they
unknown
and
undistinguished
are
to
be
buried
together
in
the
oceanthat
wide
and
nameless
sepulchre
for
a
moment
the
old
woman's
ghastly
conception
so
engrossed
the
minds
of
her
hearers
that
a
sound
abroad
in
the
night
rising
like
the
roar
of
a
blast
had
grown
broad
deep
and
terrible
before
the
fated
group
were
conscious
of
it
the
house
and
all
within
it
trembled
the
foundations
of
the
earth
seemed
to
be
shaken
as
if
this
awful
sound
were
the
peal
of
the
last
trump
young
and
old
exchanged
one
wild
glance
and
remained
an
instant
pale
affrighted
without
utterance
or
power
to
move
then
the
same
shriek
burst
simultaneously
from
all
their
lips
the
slide
the
slide
the
simplest
words
must
intimate
but
not
portray
the
unutterable
horror
of
the
catastrophe
the
victims
rushed
from
their
cottage
and
sought
refuge
in
what
they
deemed
a
safer
spotwhere
in
contemplation
of
such
an
emergency
a
sort
of
barrier
had
been
reared
alas
they
had
quitted
their
security
and
fled
right
into
the
pathway
of
destruction
down
came
the
whole
side
of
the
mountain
in
a
cataract
of
ruin
just
before
it
reached
the
house
the
stream
broke
into
two
branchesshivered
not
a
window
there
but
overwhelmed
the
whole
vicinity
blocked
up
the
road
and
annihilated
everything
in
its
dreadful
course
long
ere
the
thunder
of
the
great
slide
had
ceased
to
roar
among
the
mountains
the
mortal
agony
had
been
endured
and
the
victims
were
at
peace
their
bodies
were
never
found
the
next
morning
the
light
smoke
was
seen
stealing
from
the
cottage
chimney
up
the
mountain
side
within
the
fire
was
yet
smouldering
on
the
hearth
and
the
chairs
in
a
circle
round
it
as
if
the
inhabitants
had
but
gone
forth
to
view
the
devastation
of
the
slide
and
would
shortly
return
to
thank
heaven
for
their
miraculous
escape

had
left
separate
tokens
by
which
those
who
had
known
the
family
were
made
to
shed
a
tear
for
each
who
has
not
heard
their
name
the
story
has
been
told
far
and
wide
and

forever

a
legend
of
these
mountains

sung
their
fate
there
were
circumstances
which
led
some
to
suppose
that
a
stranger
had
been
received
into
the
cottage
on
this
awful
night
and
had
shared
the
catastrophe
of
all
its
inmates
